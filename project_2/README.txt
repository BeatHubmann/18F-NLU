==========================================
ETHZ NLU 2018 GROUP 2 PROJECT 2 SUBMISSION
==========================================

* The program was written and tested using Python 3.6.5

* The program is named 'project2_quickthoughts.py' and is converted from a Jupyter notebook

* The program will automatically include a training run. If this is not the desired behaviour and
  just a check of a trained model is desired, the ### TRAINING SECTION ### as marked in the file needs
  to be commented out.

* The pip requirements file is 'requirements.txt' -> use with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
  It uses Python's 'collection' and 'time' module as well as Numpy, Pandas and TensorFlow-GPU.

* The program requires a 'data' subdirectory while
  the 'checkpoints' subdirectory keeps saved trained models and
  the 'summaries' directory keeps the TensorBoard logs
  
  -> all these can be downloaded from https://www.polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/1dpOwuwLVBS0c2n and
     need to be placed into the program's run directory
