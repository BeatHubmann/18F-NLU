    "Your task is to build a simple LSTM language model. To be precise, we assume that words are independent given the recurrent hidden state; we compute a new hidden state given the last hidden state and last word, and predict the next word given the hidden state:\n",
    "$$ P(w_1,\\dots,w_n) = 􏰀\\prod_{t=1}^{n}P(w_t|\\mathbf{h}_t)$$\n",
    "$$ P(w_t|\\mathbf{h}_t) = \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{Wh}_t)$$\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{h}_t = f(\\mathbf{h}_{t−1}, w_{t-1}^{*})$$\n",

    "where $f$ is the LSTM recurrent function, $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|V|×d}$ are softmax weights and $\\mathbf{h_0}$ is either an all-zero constant or a trainable parameter.\n",
    "You can use the tensorflow cell implementation __[1](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/rnn_cell)__ to carry out the recurrent computation in $f$. However, you must construct the actual RNN yourself (e.g. don’t use tensorflow’s `static_rnn` or `dynamic_rnn` or any other RNN library). That means, you will need to use a python loop that sets up the unrolled graph. To make your life simpler, please follow these design choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Model and Data specification__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a special sentence-beginning symbol `<bos>` and a sentence-end symbol `<eos>` (please use exactly these, including brackets). The `<bos>` symbol is the input, when predicting the first word and the `<eos>` symbol you require your model to predict at the end of every sentence.\n",
    "- Use a maximum sentence length of 30 (including the `<bos>` and `<eos>` symbol). Ignore longer sentences during training and testing.\n",
    "- Use a special padding symbol `<pad>` (please use exactly this, including brackets) to fill up sentences of length shorter than 30. This way, all your input will have the same size.\n",
    "- Use a vocabulary consisting of the 20K most frequent words in the training set, including the symbols `<bos>`, `<eos>`, `<pad>` and `<unk>`. Replace out-of-vocabulary words with the `<unk>` symbol before feeding them into your network (don’t change the file content).\n",
    "- Provide the ground truth last word as input to the RNN, not the last word you predicted. This is common practice.\n",
    "- Language models are usually trained to minimize the cross-entropy. Use tensorflow’s `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` to compute the loss (*This operation fuses the computation of the soft-max and the cross entropy loss given the logits. For numerical stability, it’s very important to use this function.*). Use the AdamOptimizer with default parameters to minimize the loss. Use `tf.clip_by_global_norm` to clip the norm of the gradients to 5.\n",
    "- Use a batch size of 64.\n",
    "- Use the data at __[6](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/qUc2NvUh2eONfEB)__. Don’t pre-process the input further. All the data is already white-space tokenized and\n",
    "lower-cased. One sentence per line.\n",

    "- __Experiment B__: It is common practice, to pretrain word embeddings using e.g. `word2vec`. This should make your model train faster as words will come already with some useful representation. Use the code at __[3](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/2018/NLU/material/load_embeddings.py)__ to load these word embeddings __[4](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/cpicEJeC2G4tq9U)__ trained on the same corpus. Train your model again and compute evaluation perplexity.\n",
    "- __Experiment C__: It is often desirable to make the LSTM more powerful, by increasing the hidden dimensionality. However, this will naturally increase the parameters $\\mathbf{W}$ of the softmax. As a compromise, one can use a larger hidden state, but down-project it before the softmax. Increase the hidden state dimensionality from 512 to 1024, but down-project $h_t$ to dimensionality 512 before predicting $w_t$ as in\n",
